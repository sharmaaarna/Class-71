                <p> I am so happy to tell you that I have won that competition. The topic for that was 'Competitive exams should be abolished' and I was asked to speak against the topic. you know that I had taken part for the first time in debate so I was very nervous. But then my chance came and I spoke very well. It seemed that the audience were listening to me with interest. When the results were about to announced first I thought that I would not even get 3rd price but I was so glad to know that I have won the first prize in 15 participants. </p>

                <p>This inter school relay race was my first ever inter school competition.Teams where decided by our house colours, there are 4 typs of house colours Green, Blue, Yellow and my team's colour Red. There where 4 members in each team, I don't rember my team members but I do rember we  came 1st place, .We pracksted really hard and at the end it was worth it. One disadvantage I was the one who hade to run first form my team. I runing at the first part was not the disadvantage the disadvantage is we have to stand at the first line in other words stand in the last line, runing at the first part is the most importent part which I have to do and at that time I did not know the technique to run, which I discovered in the race. The race was about start me and my team were very scared and did I mention we become good friends, we all took our places and the race started I ran as fast as I could I took a impressive amount of leade as it was my first race, I made a leade till the 2nd position, and my team mates made it to the 1st position. Honestly without them I could not have won this race.</p>
